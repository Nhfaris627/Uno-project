## Project Description

This project implements a fully functional UNO card game in Java. Players can play cards, draw from the deck, and compete to reach a target score of 500 points. The game includes all standard UNO cards and special action cards such as Skip, Reverse, Draw One, Wild, and Wild Draw Two.

- IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java IDE
- JUnit 5 for running tests

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nhfaris627/Uno-project.git
cd Uno-project
```

2. Open the project in your IDE

3. Run `Main.java` to start the interactive game

4. Follow the console prompts:
   - Enter number of players (2-4)
   - Enter player names
   - Play cards by entering card indices or -1 to draw
   - Follow special card prompts (color selection for Wild cards)

## Game Rules

### Card Types and Point Values
- **Number Cards (0-9)**: Face value points
- **Skip**: 20 points
- **Reverse**: 20 points (acts as Skip in 2-player games)
- **Draw One**: 10 points
- **Wild**: 40 points
- **Wild Draw Two**: 50 points

### Gameplay
1. Each player starts with 7 cards
2. Players must match the color or value of the top discard pile card
3. Wild cards can be played at any time
4. If a player cannot play, they must draw from the deck
5. Drawn cards can be played immediately if valid
6. First player to empty their hand wins the round
7. Winner receives points equal to the sum of all opponents' hand values
8. First player to reach 500 points wins the game

### Action Card Effects
- **Skip**: Next player's turn is skipped
- **Reverse**: Direction of play is reversed (acts as Skip in 2-player games)
- **Draw One**: Next player draws one card and their turn is skipped
- **Wild**: Player chooses the color to continue play
- **Wild Draw Two**: Player chooses the color, next player draws two cards and their turn is skipped

## Known Issues

### Current Issues

1. **Multiple Rounds Not Implemented**: 
   - When a round ends (player reaches 0 cards), the game calculates scores but does not start a new round
   - Players would need to restart the program for a new game
   - **Workaround**: Game ends after first round completion
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement round reset and multi-round gameplay in Milestone 2

2. **Deck Size Discrepancy**: 
   - Current implementation uses 100 cards instead of standard 108 UNO cards
   - This is due to replacement of DRAW_TWO action cards with DRAW_ONE cards per project requirements
   - Each color has 2 SKIP, 2 REVERSE instead of 2 SKIP, 2 REVERSE, 2 DRAW_TWO
   - **Impact**: Minimal - game remains balanced and playable

3. **Scanner Resource Warning**: 
   - Scanner objects in UnoGame are not explicitly closed
   - This may cause resource leak warnings in some IDEs
   - **Reason**: Intentional design to allow continuous gameplay without input stream closure
   - **Impact**: Negligible in practice for short gaming sessions

4. **Pass Turn Method Limitation**: 
   - The `passTurn()` method is primarily for testing Steps 1-3 requirements
   - Does not integrate with the full `playTurn()` interactive system
   - Simulates playing drawn card to discard pile (not realistic gameplay)
   - **Workaround**: Use `Main.java` with `playTurn()` for actual gameplay
   - **Note**: `passTurn()` retained for backward compatibility with early milestone testing

5. **No Deck Reshuffle**: 
   - When deck runs out of cards, no automatic reshuffling of discard pile
   - Game continues but players cannot draw new cards
   - **Workaround**: 100-card deck is usually sufficient for typical games
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement discard pile reshuffling in future milestone

### Test Limitations

- The `playTurn()` method cannot be easily unit tested due to Scanner keyboard input requirements
- Private helper methods in UnoGame are not directly tested but are covered through integration testing
- Display methods (like `displayScores()`, `displayResultantState()`) are not unit tested as they only print to console

### Future Improvements

- Add GUI interface for better user experience
- Implement AI players for single-player mode
- Add save/load game functionality
- Implement multiple rounds with persistent scoring
- Add game statistics tracking
- Implement deck reshuffling when empty
- Add sound effects and animations (GUI version)
- Support for house rules and custom game modes

## Documentation

### UML Diagrams
- **Class Diagram**: Located in project root, shows all classes with complete method signatures and relationships (composition, aggregation, association)
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Two diagrams showing:
  1. Player plays a valid card (normal turn flow)
  2. Player wins a round and scoring (game completion flow)

### Data Structures
- **Documentation**: See `DataStructures.md` for detailed explanation of:
  - ArrayList usage for cards, players, and indices
  - Rationale for each data structure choice
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Trade-offs and alternatives considered

### Test Coverage
- **CardTest**: 10 tests covering constructors, getters, setters, point values, toString
- **DeckTest**: 6 tests covering initialization, drawing, shuffling, size checks
- **PlayerTest**: 10 tests covering player creation, hand management, scoring, calculations
- **UnoGameTest**: 16 tests covering game creation, turn management, scoring, winner detection

---

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Enumeration Pattern**: Card.Color and Card.Value for type-safe card properties
2. **Composition**: Card contains Color and Value enums
3. **Aggregation**: UnoGame manages Players and Deck, Player and Deck manage Cards
4. **Model-View Separation**: Game logic separated from display methods
5. **Factory-like Initialization**: Deck automatically creates and shuffles cards on construction
